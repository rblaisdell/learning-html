<hr>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%">This is my first paragraph! After learning about the HTML style element, I incorporated several things into this paragraph to make it my own. I was able to change the font to "Georgia," and I bumped up the font size as well. <br> <br> I also used a break in the middle to separate these lines of text! <br> <br> As you can see from the header, I've also learned a little bit about alignment, text color, and horizontal rulers.</p>
<h6 style="font-family:georgia;">-March 7th, 2020</h6>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%">I've learned some other useful formatting tricks as well.</p>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%"><i>This text is italic.</i></p>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%"><b>This text is bold.</b>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%">This text is <small>small.</small></p>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%"><mark>This text is marked/highlighted.</mark></p>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%"><del>This text is deleted/removed.</del></p>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%">This text is <sub>subscripted.</sub></p>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%">This text is <sup>superscripted.</sup></p>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%">Last but not least, today I learned that there is a list of emoji unicode references on the website I'm using to learn HTML. So, I used the peach emoji hexadecimal code to add some spunk to my header! &#x1F495;</p>

<h6 style="font-family:georgia;">-March 8th, 2020</h6>

<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%">Today, I learned how to put <q>quotation marks</q> around text using HTML.</p>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%">I also started exploring how to do blockquotes! Here is a quote from the official Pokemon website about Bulbasaur:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/bulbasaur">
Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. <br>By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger.

<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:120%">You can use the abbreviation element to provide information about an abbreviation to your broswer. This can also be useful for accessibility! <br>If you put your mouse over the abbreviation <abbr title="Rocket League Championship Series">RLCS</abbr>, you'll see what it stands for!
